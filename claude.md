Phase 1: 
Whenver I am asking for code changes or implementation, verifiy and explain me the code that is written 

Phase 2: 
Do not have to keep on making a new file, ask me if i want to make a How to guide at the end of the implemenetation 

Phase3: 
I need you to do git status on stages and commits to keep track of implementations with files and codes 

Phase 4:
Make Sure To Create Unit Test For Functionalities 

Phase 5: Whenever implementing, I want you to test the function first and feed me in with the loop to make sure the implementation is correct and write test cases for further debugging
